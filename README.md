# Generalised Data Structure Library (C++)

## 📌 Overview
The **Generalised Data Structure Library** is a comprehensive C++ project that implements commonly used linked list data structures using a **generic (template-based) approach**.  
This library allows the same data structure code to work with **multiple data types** such as `int`, `char`, `float`, etc., without duplication.

The project is designed following **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** standards and is suitable for:
- Academic projects
- Practical submissions
- Learning internal working of data structures
- Reusable DSA implementations

## 🧩 Data Structures Implemented

|        Type                 | Node Class     | Functionality Class | Status  |
|-----------------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------|
| Singly Linear Linked List   | `SinglyLLLnode` |  `SinglyLLL`      | ✅ Done |
| Singly Circular Linked List | `SinglyCLLnode` | ` SinglyCLL`      | ✅ Done |
| Doubly Linear Linked List   | `DoublyLLLnode` |  `DoublyLLL`      | ✅ Done |
| Doubly Circular Linked List | `DoublyCLLnode` |  `DoublyCLL`      | ✅ Done |

## ⚙️ Features
- Generic programming using **C++ templates**
- Fully object-oriented design
- Dynamic memory management
- Well-structured and documented code
- Supports multiple data types
- Single library file for easy integration

## 🛠️ Operations Supported
Each data structure supports the following operations:
- `InsertFirst()`
- `InsertLast()`
- `InsertAtPos()`
- `DeleteFirst()`
- `DeleteLast()`
- `DeleteAtPos()`
- `Display()`
- `Count()`

## 💡 Key Concepts Used
- Templates (Generic Programming)
- Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Linked List Logic
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Circular and Doubly Linked Structures

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
* To understand how data structures work internally
* To avoid rewriting code for different data types
* To build a reusable DSA library
* To strengthen C++ template and pointer concepts
